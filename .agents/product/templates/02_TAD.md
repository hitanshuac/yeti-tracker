# Technical Architecture Document (TAD)

## 1. System Context
[Provide a high-level overview of how this system fits into the broader ecosystem. Who interacts with it?]

## 2. Component Architecture
*List the core components (e.g., API Gateway, Celery Workers, Database).*
- **[Component Name]:** [Responsibility]
- **[Component Name]:** [Responsibility]

## 3. Data Flow / State Management
[Describe how data moves through the system. E.g., User -> React Frontend -> FastAPI -> DuckDB]

## 4. Database Schema (High Level)
*Define the core entities and their relationships.*
```sql
-- Example Schema
CREATE TABLE users (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    email VARCHAR UNIQUE
);
```

## 5. Technology Stack
- **Frontend:** [e.g., Next.js, Tailwind]
- **Backend:** [e.g., FastAPI, Python 3.11]
- **Database:** [e.g., DuckDB]
- **Infrastructure:** [e.g., Hugging Face Spaces, Docker]
