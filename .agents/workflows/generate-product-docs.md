# Workflow: Generate Product Documentation

**Trigger:** Explicit invocation via `/ask run @[.agents/workflows/generate-product-docs.md] <Project Idea>`

## Objective
Before allowing any code generation for a new project, the Agent MUST interview the user and fill out the 5 core Product & Systems Design templates located in `.agents/product/templates/`. This ensures a deterministic, hallucination-free coding phase.

## Execution Steps

### Phase 1: Interview & Context Gathering
1. Ask the user for a high-level description of what they want to build.
2. Ask clarifying questions to narrow down the MVP scope, target audience, and preferred tech stack.

### Phase 2: Document Generation
The Agent must sequentially generate populated versions of the 5 templates (saving them in a `docs/` or `design/` folder for the project):
1. `01_PRD.md` (Product Requirements)
2. `02_TAD.md` (Technical Architecture)
3. `03_SECURITY.md` (Security & Access)
4. `04_FRONTEND.md` (Frontend Spec)
5. `05_TICKETS.md` (Actionable backlog)

### Phase 3: Review & Lock-in
1. Present the completed documents to the user for approval.
2. Once approved, the Agent may proceed to execute `05_TICKETS.md` sequentially. Do NOT write code until all 5 documents are approved.

### Phase 4: Ticket Execution & Testing Loop
For each ticket in `05_TICKETS.md`:
1. Write the implementation code for the ticket.
2. Execute `.agents/workflows/test-automation.md` to auto-generate test cases from the ticket's acceptance criteria.
3. Run all tests. If any fail, log the failure via `.agents/workflows/error-observability.md`, fix the code, and re-run.
4. Only proceed to the next ticket when all tests pass.
